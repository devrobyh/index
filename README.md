# about this "blog"
This repository is filled with files of HTML pages and media content for the blog post, which is freely viewable for anyone to see what kind of activities I was doing with this repository: such as uploading, modifying or even fixing the issues.
If you want to recreate this with your own for your website, feel free to do so and I don't care.
Have a nice day, bye for now!
